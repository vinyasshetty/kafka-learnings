# Kafka Learning

This covers my journey about learning Kafka.When i used to learn something new i used to always write down my understanding in a book but soon i realized i had these bunch of notebooks on different technologies that i was trying to maintain so this is my first attempt to have everything i learn about a technology documented online in a GItBook.

I am getting used to it and only trouble is drawing some pics which was much simpler to do on notebook than on gitbook.Have to figure how to draw on gitbook.
